<h2>About Sleep Tight</h2>
</center>
<p>Who: The average kid has a busy day. There's school, running around to class to class, going to sports practice or other activities, and doing your homework. By the end of the day you are extremely tired, your body needs a break. Sleep allows your body to rest for the next day so that you are energized and ready to go for tomorrow. It is recommenced that teenagers need 9 and 9 Â½ hours of sleep every night but that is not the case for the average teen. According to nationwidechildrens.org (a very trusted source) the average teen gets about 7-6 ours of sleep. So, my targeted audience for my project are grade 9 students. I know for me that this is a problem because some night I don't get enough sleep so when I go to school it becomes difficult to concentrate and do my work to the best of my ability so I wanted to make a app that helps grade 9 students to have a better sleep at night.</p>
<p>What: As I stated before, I want to make a website/app that monitors your sleep habits and corrects them. I want my app to notify the user that it is time to go to bed. There will be a home screen in which you can choose how long you want to sleep, monitor your sleep habitats, a built in alarm and finally a chart in which it shows you how you have been sleeping the past month.</p>

<p>Where: Idealistically, I want to have it on a phone as people use there phones more than they use but because of the restriction of this project it would most likely be on your computer.</p>

<p>When: This app will be used at night as the apps function is to help you sleep better.</p>

<p>Why: It is proven that kids who regularly get an adequate amount of sleep have improved attention, behavior, learning, memory, and overall mental and physical health. Kids these days don't grasp the importance of a good night rest so they are prone to a lack of attention, behavior, learning and memory.</p>
